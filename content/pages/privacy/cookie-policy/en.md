### Table of contents

## 1. What are cookies?

A cookie is a small file that stores information on your device. Your web browser downloads it on the first visit to a website. The next time you open this website with the same device, the cookie and the information stored in it are either:

- sent back to the website that created it (**first-party cookie**), or
- sent to another website it belongs to (**third-party cookie**).

This enables the website to detect that you have opened it previously with this browser and, in some cases, to vary the displayed content.

**Web storage** (local storage and session storage) has similar functionality to cookies. In the following, the term “cookies” refers to **both**, web storage and regular cookies.

**Cookie categories**

There are several categories of cookies including the following cookie categories.

- **Essential cookies**: These cookies are strictly necessary for you to browse a website and use its features.
- **Preference cookies**: Preference cookies are not absolutely necessary for the technical operation of a website but increase user-friendliness.
- **Statistics cookies**: Statistics cookies or performance cookies collect information about how you use a website, e.g., which pages you visited, to improve website functions. The information is aggregated and not used to identify you.
- **Marketing cookies**: Marketing cookies track your activity to deliver relevant advertising or to limit the number of times you see an ad. That information can be shared with other organizations or advertisers.

## 2. How do we use cookies?

On our portal demonstrator we use **strictly necessary (essential)** first party cookies and web storage only. They are needed for you to use the portal's features, which is why no consent is required for them and why you are not asked to agree to anything.
